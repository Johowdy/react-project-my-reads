# MyReads Application

The MyReads application lets you find and categorize books into three categories:
- Books you have read
- Books you are currently reading
- Books you would like to read

The main page allows you to change the category for books that are already in
your collection, and the Search page allows you to find new books to add to the
different categories.

## To Use MyReads

To use the MyReads application you will need to clone or download this
repository and then run `npm install` then `npm start` in a Terminal.
